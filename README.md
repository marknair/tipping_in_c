# Tipping in C

Create a C program that includes a function to calculate the total cost of a meal at a restaurant, including tax and tip.

## Requirements

Create a function called calculate_total_cost that takes at least two arguments:

- float meal_cost: The base cost of the meal
- int tip_percentage: The percentage of the tip (as a whole number, e.g., 15 for 15%)

The function should also account for a fixed tax rate of 8%.
The function should return the total cost of the meal, including tax and tip.
Use the CS50 library for input/output operations.

Please use the starter code to begin.
